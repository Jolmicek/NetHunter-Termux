when installing Termux, it will open the application and type these commands:
termux-setup-storage
pkg install wget
wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWr
chmod +x install-nethunter-termux
./install-nethunter-termux

when you're done just type nethunter to start Kali Linux.

If you get an error try writing:
pkg install root-repo

I hope it works and have fun 😎😁😂
